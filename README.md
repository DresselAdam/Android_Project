# Android_Project
COP 2001 Programming Methodology.

Sprint 5 Outcomes (Approximate Time - 3 hours)

	- Changed opening page to the homeFragment
	- Added an imageView to homeFragment and glossaryFragment https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ImageView
		- Added resource file and used in image view
		- Changed image properties with image manipulation editor GIMP https://www.gimp.org/
	- Added a scrollView to homeFragment and glossaryFragment https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ScrollView?hl=en

Sprint 4 Outcomes (Approximate Time - 4 hours)

	- Followed tutorial on making a functional navigation bar with fragments. First I added a framelayout and BottomNavigationView to my main activity and then applied appropriate color and string values. 
	- Next I created a menu resource file for the bottomNavigationView to refer to. It is a menu xml file that has five items pertaining to the five navigation choices.
	- After this I created a method in the MainActivity called mOnNavigationItemSelectedListener, which checks which corresponding item from the navigation menu was pressed.
	- Then I made another method called openFFragment which creates a Fragment Transaction to open the FrameLayout container.
	- The kotlin files for each fragment were also adjusted per the tutorial I used for these changes.
	
	Developed features with help from the android docs - https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/design/widget/BottomNavigationView
	and this tutorial -
