# Project Title
Android project for learning about app development. Project is a competitive game guide for the video game Dragonballfighterz. This project was made to gain experience developing an android application in android studio. 
This project was an inpendent venture made in the summer of 2019. I was introduced to concepts such as the activity lifecycle and live debugging on a smart phone. I wanted to become familiar with the world of app development because mobile devices are a part of everyday life. This project was made in free time during my time as a software engineering student, still becoming familiar with software development, and was my first project using kotlin.
